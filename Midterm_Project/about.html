        The color generator website is a website that allows 
        you to explore color palettes and generate complementary colors. 
        This site is great for web desingers and graphic designers if they want to use color 
        schemes for their designs. It's also great for helping you select the right color 
        that you'll need for your designs, which includes websites, apps, and even grpahic elements, 
        illustrator, and more. When you're feeling stuck, the color generator can suggest 
        unique combinations you might not have thought of, sparking new ideas for your 
        projects.
